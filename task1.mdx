I went through and added version toggling and language updates pretty easily. I wrapped them neatly
within the docs.json file and looked up the tooling via https://www.mintlify.com/docs/organize/navigation.
I also got rid of all of the v2 headers for all of the v2 titles because it seems a little redundant now. I got inspiration from
other mintlify websites such as LangChain to see what would look appropriate for a documentation for Salsa as a Service.
I think it scales pretty easily for language and version support, by just appending languages and new versions within the navigation tab of the 
docs.json. I also changed up the taskbar and footer to be more in line with what real documentation woudl look like.
