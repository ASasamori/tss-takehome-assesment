# Quality Control

Ensure consistent salsa quality with AI-powered prediction and automated IoT testing.

## Overview

v2.0 introduces AI quality prediction, automated IoT testing equipment, and computer vision for visual inspection. Catch quality issues before they happen.

## AI Quality Prediction

### Predictive Quality Scoring

AI predicts quality scores before batch completion:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Analyzes ingredient quality data" icon="search">
AI analyzes ingredient quality data
</Card>

<Card title="Real-time monitoring" icon="eye">
Monitors production conditions in real-time
</Card>

<Card title="95% accuracy" icon="check">
Predicts final quality score with 95% accuracy
</Card>

<Card title="Early warnings" icon="bell">
Provides early warnings for potential issues
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
// Example: Get AI quality prediction
const prediction = await salsa.ai.quality.predict({
  batch_id: "BATCH-2024-001",
  current_stage: "mixing"
});

console.log(`Predicted quality: ${prediction.score}/10`);
console.log(`Confidence: ${prediction.confidence}%`);
```

```python Python
# Example: Get AI quality prediction
prediction = salsa.ai.quality.predict(
    batch_id="BATCH-2024-001",
    current_stage="mixing"
)

print(f"Predicted quality: {prediction['score']}/10")
print(f"Confidence: {prediction['confidence']}%")
```
</CodeGroup>

### Anomaly Detection

AI identifies quality issues in real-time:

- Unusual ingredient combinations
- Temperature deviations during production
- Inconsistent mixing times
- pH level variations

## IoT Automated Testing

### Connected Testing Equipment

Automated quality tests with IoT devices:

</Card>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Computer Vision Inspection

AI-powered visual quality control:

- Automated visual inspection using cameras
- Defect detection (contamination, inconsistency)
- Portion control verification
- Packaging quality checks

<Info>
**New in v2.0**: Computer vision systems can inspect 100% of production, compared to manual sampling in v1.0.

## Quality Scoring

### AI-Enhanced Scoring

Machine learning improves quality assessment:

```javascript
// Example: Record quality with AI assistance
const qualityCheck = await salsa.ai.quality.recordScore({
  batch_id: "BATCH-2024-001",
  automated_scores: {
    visual_ai: 9.2,
    ph_sensor: 8.8,
    viscosity: 9.0,
    temperature: 10.0
  },
  manual_scores: {
    taste: 9.5
  },
  ai_analysis: true
});
```

## Predictive Maintenance

AI monitors equipment health:

- Predicts equipment failures before they occur
- Identifies calibration drift in testing equipment
- Recommends maintenance schedules
- Reduces downtime by 75%

## Quality Standards

### Smart Standards

AI-adjusted quality standards:

- Automatic threshold adjustments based on historical data
- Seasonal variation compensation
- Supplier quality correlation
- Customer feedback integration

### Real-Time Compliance

Automated compliance monitoring:

- HACCP automated documentation
- FDA regulation tracking
- Real-time violation alerts
- Digital audit trails

## Quality Insights

### AI-Powered Analytics

Deep quality insights:

- Root cause analysis for quality issues
- Correlation between ingredients and scores
- Supplier quality impact analysis
- Production condition optimization

### Continuous Improvement

AI suggests quality improvements:

- Ingredient substitution recommendations
- Process optimization suggestions
- Equipment upgrade recommendations
- Training needs identification

<Warning>
**Critical Quality Alerts**: AI-detected safety issues trigger immediate production halts and manager notifications.
