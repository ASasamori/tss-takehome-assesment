  thresholds: {
    temperature: { min: 35, max: 40, unit: "F" },
    freshness_score: { min: 8.0, max: 10.0 },
    consistency: { min: 7.5 }
  },
  alert_channels: ["email", "sms", "push", "slack"],
  auto_action: {
    low_quality_detected: "pause_production",
    temperature_violation: "notify_manager"
  }
};
```

```python Python
# Example: Configure quality monitoring via API
quality_config = {
    "enabled": True,
    "monitoring_interval": "5m",  # Check every 5 minutes
    "thresholds": {
        "temperature": {"min": 35, "max": 40, "unit": "F"},
        "freshness_score": {"min": 8.0, "max": 10.0},
