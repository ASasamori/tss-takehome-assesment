# Brief explanation of your component choices:
- Why you chose specific components for specific content
- How your enhancements improve the user experience
- Any custom styling decisions and their rationale

I would say for the most part my componenets were pretty programatic and make the most sense.
I used callouts for when there was something to be noted based on version differences or warnings.
I used columns and cards to display different capabilities were appropriate.
Code groups was generally used for all code. (I made sure that they included both Python and JavaScript for simplicity)
I used steps for whenever there was any numbering previously to show the steps to take. 
I used tabs to group similar things that could be swappaded (but also wanted to use something different in a way).
And I used expandable for things that were a bit extra in a way.

I would say my custom styling decisions and enhancements improve the user experience being easier to navigate.
I think having visuals and being able to cycle through information quicker makes it easier. When there is more block text, 
it is harder to understand all of the information being thrown at you all at once. With columns, icons, and callouts, it is easier to 
understand which material is relevant to the fields. I chose to use react components for the analytics and reporting since it seems to Capture
qualitative data the best way. I didn't want to overuse custom styling to drown out mintlify elements, however.
